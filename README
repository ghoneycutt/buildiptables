About:
======

buildiptables is a simple bash script to compile snippets into an iptables
script. It consists of three directories: snippets, scripts, and hosts.

snippets - firewall rules that correlate with some function
hosts    - files that correspond to a host and list all the snippets, in order, to be compiled
scripts  - compiled scripts to be installed on your hosts

Howto:
======

1. create hosts/<hostname> and add snippets, one per line - order matters

2. run ./buildiptables <hostname> or just ./buildall.sh

3. scp scripts/<hostname> to host

4. login to host and install the script somewhere.
    $ sudo install -o root -g root -m 700 ~/iptables.sh /root/iptables.sh 

5. run the script
    $ sudo /root/iptables.sh

6. update your firewall
    $ sudo /sbin/service iptables save active
    $ sudo /sbin/service iptables start


Snippets:
=========

By convention, each snippet's first line is === <filename> ===

Each snippet should also end with a blank line for readability in the compiled script
